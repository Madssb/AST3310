    Args:
        mass (float): mass inside sphere of radius radial_position, with mass
            density of sun-like star.
        radial_position (float): distance from center of sun-like star.
        mass_density (float): local mass density at radial_position, inside
            sun-like star.
        temperature (float): local temperature at radial_position, inside
            sun-like star.
        pressure (float): Local pressure inside at radial_position,
            inside sun-like star.
        luminosity (float): luminosity emitted by mass inside sphere of radius
            radial_position, with mass density of sun-like star.sphere with
            radius equal to radial position, consisting of sun-like star.
        sanity_check (Bool): False if not used for sanity check,
            true if used for sanity check.
